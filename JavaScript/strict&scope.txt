********** Strict **********
"use strict";
put this at top of the file or we can write it inside a function that, strick mode will be applied on the function locally rather than
globally in the whole file.
e.g:
function myfunc(){
    "use strick";
}
-> Undeclared variables and objects
-> Mistyping a variable names
-> Accidently creating a global variable
-> Assigning variable to non-writable properties
-> Deleting a variable or object or function
-> Duplicating a parameter name
-> Writing read only / get only properties
-> eval / arguments cannot be used as variables
-> using keywords that are reserved for future javascript versions.


********** Scope **********
It basically is the accessibility [visibility] of the variables.
There three types of scopes in javascript:
i) Function scope: Variable declared locally in the function. Can't access these variables from outside of the function.
ii) Block scope: Variables inside {} like class, if-else; Can't access from outside unless declared by var.
iii) Global scope: variables declared outside any kind of {}. These variables can be access from anywhere in the document.
