-> How the web works [DNS & HTTP] = When we type a address (e.g., www.google.com) the browser uses DNS to find the IP Adress
					of that specific server. After getting the IP Address broswers send the HTTP request
					to the server containing out req and the server replies a HTTP response with HTML,
					CSS, JavaScript and images & videos which our browser renders in the display.

-> Critical Rendering Path = It's the process which the browser goes through to turn HTML, CSS & JavaScript into a visible webpage.
				i) HTML is loaded and parsed -> Browser reads the HTML and creates the structure called DOM
				ii) CSS is loaded and parsed -> Browser reads CSS and creates the CSSOM.
				iii) DOM + CSSOM + JS = render tree
				iv) Browser calculate the layout using the render tree then paints the screen according the layout.

-> WebPack & Vite = Back then we didn't have any native way to bind js files into moduler way, Webpack was used by developers to do this binding.
			Then the import export was introduced that made the binding multiple js files faster. Then comes vite that enhances the 
			js module powers into another level
			

-> ESLint : Is this a Linter for JS & TS, It analyzes your code to find syntax error, code quality issues, and styles violations
		i) Catch syntax errors early
		ii) enforece coding standards.
		iii) Help with code consistency across a team.

-> Prettier : It automatically format your code to follow consistent style rules (indentations, spacing, line breaks etc)
